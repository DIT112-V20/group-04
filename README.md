## What
The HealthRover will deliver medicine and medical equipment to set locations, inside or outside a hospital, without the need for human contact. 

The solution consists of an android application for interfacing with the user and a smart-car for accomplishing the physical task of delivering  goods.

## Why
It will minimize the amount of human contact amidst a pandemic and reduce the risk of spreading contagious diseases. It will help medical professionals in and out of hospitals by improving the efficiency of the medical workflow by automating medicine and equipment distribution.

## How
Healthcare professionals will have the opportunity to provide patients with the needed medication or medical equipment  by the use of a self-driven car along with a smartphone application. A simple graphical user interface will guide the end-user through the process of the delivery. It will provide features such as voice control, access through Wi-Fi as well as capabilities that support the self-driving car, such as obstacle avoidance and GPS-based navigation.

The android application is developed using an object oriented approach by applying proven design and architecture patterns as well as early and continuous testing to ensure the robustness and high quality of the application.
